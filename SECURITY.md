# Security Policy

## Scope

Resolve is a **registry of issues and solutions**, not a software product. This repository contains documentation, templates, and links to external projects.

## Reporting Issues

If you discover a security concern related to:

- **This repository** (e.g., malicious links, compromised templates): Open an issue or email the maintainers directly
- **A linked solution**: Please report directly to that project's maintainers

## Linked Projects

Solutions listed in Resolve are maintained independently. We encourage all linked projects to:

- Use a clear, permissive license
- Follow secure coding practices
- Respond promptly to reported vulnerabilities

## Contact

For sensitive reports, please reach out to the repository maintainers directly rather than opening a public issue.
